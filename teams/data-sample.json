Here are some updates on a few different fronts:</p>\n<p>We have had a number of folks from the cohort that have successfully installed the wrapper into their captivate packages and reported to our cohort LRS, ScormCloud LRS and from ScormCloud LMS.</p>\n<p>The biggest barrier to entry right now is the manual process of installing the wrapper in each captivate publish package, as it requires you to add several files and manipulate several lines of code.  This method doesn't account well for the variability of many different publishing options.  I have mentioned the solve for this is creating a desktop app that you can drag and drop package into that will apply your preferences and spit out a ready to roll zip package for your  LMS or Server. Continued to make progress this last week - All of the preferences are now UI customizable, next step is to make the drag and drop feature work and then parse the code and insert what is needed.</p>\n<p>Attached a few screen shots in comments last week, but have included some updated looks the week.  The UI still leaves a lot to be desired (curse my limited CSS abilities!) but it is getting close to be functional.</p>\n<p>Still have not audited quizzing statements and compatibility...If anyone in the cohort heavily uses captivates native quizzing features and would be willing to share some real use cases/quizzes for compatibility and reporting expectations that would be a big help and the kick in the pants needed to stop my procrastination on this final item :)</p>"

One was an IoT (@anthonyalteri ?) ... that would imply an Arduino based tech. This would be a great idea to record a live session of a D&amp;D game. (Suggest to do this at the xAPI party.)</p>\n<p>Another would be using Discord. I am not familiar with this kind of development and I am not sure if there is a plugin or API that would work for this.</p>\n<p>My suggestion is to create a battle simulation between a set of characters and monsters using Storyline. Jonathan, though he got a Dungeon Master's guide from the library, we both are not D&amp;D players. (I used to play Marvel Superheroes and I currently play X-Wing tabletop miniatures games with my son.)</p>\n<p>The idea I had in mind that one person can do the design, another with the Storyline 360 file which would include a backend dungeon made in HTML5 with Zim.JS like this the screenshot (see attached image) that can communicate with Storyline. (I know how to do this.) You can move the character and once you hit a certain spot, you might get loot or an encounter a dragon. Then we can use xAPI statements like  \"hero slew dragon\".</p>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/424807/65703804-5be2ac00-e053-11e9-91c1-de105f4e9957.png\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/424807/65703804-5be2ac00-e053-11e9-91c1-de105f4e9957.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p>\n<p>So the mandate would be where the user can select a hero (wizard, barbarian, thief, dwarf) to determine their best effectiveness against certain categories of monsters. How do we determine this with xAPI data? What kinds of activities would we need to implement? Most importantly, what kind of outcomes can we determine and what is the success criteria?</p>\n<p>Are you \"game\"? <g-emoji class=\"g-emoji\" alias=\"wink\" fallback-src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png\">😉</g-emoji></p>"

Success =statements in your LRS of choice.</li>\n<li><strong>Phase Two</strong> is based on creating custom interactions using the basic Unity3D tools that leverage the framework to send purposeful statements based on the 3D Scene.</li>\n<li><strong>Phase Three</strong> is focused on creating a shared library of interactive elements called \"asset bundles\" that can be shared within an xAPI enabled Unity3D scene</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What this means is that once we have a Unity3D scene up-and-running with GBLxAPI, you are free to \"play in the sandbox\" and create simple (or complex)  interactive elements that you can share with others through GitHub.</p>\n<p><strong>What is your project timeline?</strong><br>\nWe will develop a timeline based on the duration of the Fall Cohort. Specific scene assets may take on a lifecycle of their own as branches of development.</p>\n<p><strong>What resources are you using in your project?</strong><br>\nUnity3D minimum version (TBD) -Note: We may pick a current version and stick with it to avoid upgrade conflicts. (even though it is tempting to update Unity3D every time!).<br>\nOther Assets, such as 3rd party Add-ins, may be considered but should be packaged or noted where required.  Use Free 3D assets or design/build based on your level of interest.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the goal of your project?</strong><br>\nThe goal is to build an extensible platform on top of Unity3D that allows creative builders of all skill levels to work towards an emerging standard of interactive 3D content that conforms to xAPI specifications.</p>\n<p><strong>What does the team hope to learn as a result of this project?</strong><br>\nWe hope to learn that while Unity3D has a steep learning curve, it is possible to achieve very interactive results by starting with a shared repository of elements.</p>"

(Nice to have, valuable). LRS as the datasource.<br>\n--Admins would always have access to LRS Dashboards or external data analytics, but in the scene, xAPI data could be invaluable to the learner.<br>\n--Looking at Postman for QA testing of LRS</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>--Areas where your team may need support?</strong><br>\n-- We may need support with installation of Open Source LL, since we want to learn how to do this activity to support ongoing development. EDIT: OpenSource LL installed on AWS! Now comparing to Enterprise LL with Journeys, with thanks to the LL team for supporting this Cohort and team instance.<br>\n--We may need some support on how to leverage GitHub for basic co-authoring and pull of branched changes.</p>\n<p>--What we hope to accomplish in the next week?<br>\n#1- Learning Locker Open Source - COMPLETE<br>\n#2- Basic Unity3D scene with GBLxAPI installed<br>\n#3- GitHub repository with starter Scene</p>"
